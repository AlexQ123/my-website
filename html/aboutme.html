            I'm a junior studying in Computer Science at Brigham Young University. 
            My goal is to make valuable contributions to the practice of computer science, particularly in machine learning 
            and artificial intelligence. I seek a productive career accompanied by lifelong learning, as well as societal and ethical responsibility.

            I really like sports and doing things outside. I especially like to ski and go to the gym, which ironically 
            both result a lot of shredding (if you know what I mean). Here's where I spend a lot of my winters:

            I was also a varsity wrestler in high school, and as brutal as that sport was, it taught me how to really work hard towards a goal 
            (and besides, learning how to do throws and pin people was pretty fun). I also enjoy playing pretty much any other sport for fun, 
            although I'm really bad at basketball and baseball so I won't be taking any 1 on 1 challenges.

            Unfortunately, there's not a song out there where both of these artists hop on the track. If there was, I'd probably like it. I love music!
            I've been playing the piano for 13 years now, and even though I've had less time to tickle the ivories recently, I cherish the moments when 
            I get to. I played a lot of classical, romantic, baroque, and contemporary music, all of which I like to listen to as well. I've entered quite 
            a few piano competitions, placing 1st in multiple Encore Keyboard competitions and the Salt Lake Piano competition. I even got to perform in 
            Carnegie Hall in 2015 after placing 2nd in the American Protégé International Music Competition. More recently, I've performed with the Utah 
            Philharmonic Orchestra and the Utah Valley Symphony twice. Check out this video of me playing with the Utah Valley Symphony!

            After seeing that video, people think there's no way that I could ever like rap. Well guess what? I do. In fact, I also like pop, indie, 
            rock, country, and oldies. I love making music and listening to music, and I do these things a lot.

            I'm a pretty casual gamer, and I'll play the Xbox every now and then. Between school and music and sports, I hardly find any time to game, 
            but it's pretty fun. Currently, my favorite game is Rocket League -- if you've never heard of it, it's pretty much car soccer. But, it's 
            way cooler than it sounds! Here's me dribbling the ball, about to flick it over the defender and score a game-winning last second goal:

          <span class="aboutmecontent">
            While Rocket League is super fun, nothing beats the original driving game: Mario Kart Wii. That is the best game of all time.
